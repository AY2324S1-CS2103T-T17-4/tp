### Project: NUSCourseMates

NUSCourseMates is a desktop address book application used for keeping track of the courses your contacts are taking.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add student's course in AddCommand.
  * What it does: allows the user to indicate the course that the student's contact is taking.
  * Justification: This feature is inline with our project specification of tracking the courses.
  * Highlights: This improvement affects both existing commands and commands that will be implemented in the future. It necessitated a thorough examination of design choices. The implementation was also difficult because it required adjustments to existing commands.
  * Credits: *seedu AB3 code* was being referenced.

* **New Feature**: To be added soon
