## Project: NUSCourseMates

### Overview
NUSCourseMates is a desktop address book application used for keeping track of the courses your contacts are taking.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 19 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the Telehandle Field to a student's profile (Pull Request: [#75](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/75))
  * What it does: This new feature adds a Telehandle field to a student's profile. It allows users to include a student's telehandle as part of their contact information in NUSCoursemates.
  * Justification: The addition of the Telehandle field is particularly valuable in NUSCoursemates as the application serves as a contact book for students. With Telegram being a primary mode of communication among students, it is essential to have a convenient way to store and access fellow students' telehandles for seamless communication.
  * Highlights:  Implementing this feature posed challenges as it required making adjustments to various existing commands and tests within the application.
  * Credits: This feature implementation referenced the seedu AB3 code.


* **New Feature**: Feedback Feature (Pull Request: [#97](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/97))
  * What it does: This new feature introduces a feedback mechanism within the NUSCoursemates application. It enables users to provide feedback on the application, its features, and their overall experience. Users will be directed to a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ymKYKfXse5PoPhvW6) where they can share their feedback.
  * Justification: The Feedback Feature is a valuable addition to NUSCoursemates as it empowers users to share their opinions, report issues, and suggest improvements. This approach allows us to continually enhance the application based on user feedback.
  * Highlights: The introduction of this feature enhances user engagement and demonstrates the development team's commitment to improving the application. It promotes a collaborative environment where users play a vital role in shaping the application's future.
  * Credits: The implementation of the Feedback Feature involved referencing the seedu AB3 code.


* **Enhancements to existing features**: Enhanced the Feedback and Help window pop-ups to align with the current GUI theme (Pull Request: [#137](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/137))
  * What it does: Change the Feedback and Help window pop-ups to fit the GUI theme.
  * Justification: Ensuring that the theme of the feedback window matches the overall GUI theme is crucial for maintaining visual consistency. Inconsistencies in design elements can create a disjointed appearance that may confuse or distract users.
  * Highlights: This feature necessitates a in-depth understanding of GUI principles and the intricate dependencies involved in modifying the appearance of a simple popup window. The primary focus of this feature is to align with the user's chosen GUI theme, thereby ensuring the functionality of the entire interface.
  * Credits: The implementation of the Feedback Feature involved referencing the seedu AB3 code.
